TSNE was done on two sets of three classes of flowers:
1. 'Bluebell', 'Daisy', 'Sunflower', 
2. 'Bluebell', 'Sunflower', 'Tigerlily'

Bluebell is blue in colour
Sunflower is yellow + black in colour
Daisy is white in colour
Tigerlily is orange in colour (and thus would be closely associated with Sunflower
