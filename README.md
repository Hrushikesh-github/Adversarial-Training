TSNE on [flowers dataset](https://github.com/Hrushikesh-github/flower-17). Taking pixels as the feature.

TSNE was done on two sets of three classes of flowers:
1. 'Bluebell', 'Daisy', 'Sunflower', 
2. 'Bluebell', 'Sunflower', 'Tigerlily'

Bluebell is blue in colour,
Sunflower is yellow in colour,
Daisy is white in colour,
Tigerlily is orangish-black in colour
